    <abstract>
      <para>Rewetted peatlands will experience more frequent drought conditions as the climate
        changes, and therefore it is necessary to study how nutrient cycling (and corresponding
        greenhouse gas emission) will respond in these novel ecosystems. Thus far, the impact of
        drought on ammonia oxidizing microbes in peatlands is unclear, despite their role as a
        rate-limiting step in nitrification. This study aims to identify trends in archaeal and
        bacterial ammonia oxidizer abundances and their feedbacks with nitrogen-cycling genes in two
        rewetted fens in northeastern Germany (PW and CW) from April 2018 to February 2019. Drought
        conditions in the peat soils is neutrally defined via a k-means clustering algorithm, and
        AOA and AOB abundances are quantified with amoA gene copy numbers in both DNA and RNA
        samples from the soil at time points throughout a drought cycle. These results are supported
        by metatranscriptome analysis and phylogenetic-based clade assignment of AOA ASVs from 16S
        rRNA amplicon sequencing. Shifts in nitrifying communities were found to correlate with
        overall site hydrological stability, with AOB outnumbering AOA at both sites. Both AOB and
        AOB increased at the PW site during the drought, following a decrease in nitrogen fixation
        gene expression after drought onset and preceding an increase in ANRA-associated genes at
        the end of the drought cycle. In contrast, CW AOA and AOB showed limited dynamism in
        response to drought. The feedbacks between water table stability, drought and the prevalence
        of ammonia oxidation functional genes is crucial to understand how novel rewetted fen
        ecosystems will respond to climate change, as well as how these conditions will further
        affect the quality of the peat substrate and microbial-driven nutrient cycling.</para>

          <para>Soil sampling:</para>
          <para>Soil samples were collected from WETSCAPES project sites between April 2017 and
            October 2019 [1,2,3]. Samples were collected from a rewetted percolation fen (PW) and a
            rewetted coastal fen (CW) in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. PW is in the catchment
            areas of the rivers Trebel and Recknitz and was deeply drained in the 20th century
            before rewetting in 1998 as part of an EU-Life initiative [2]. CW was first drained for
            agricultural purposes in 1850 and rewetted via dike removal in 1993; since then, it has
            been periodically been flooded by brackish water from the Bay of Greifswald on the
            Baltic Sea [2]. While CW is currently used for cattle pasture, the PW site is not
            utilized for agricultural purposes and is managed via biannual mowing 2].</para>
          <para>Three peat cores were sampled from each of the sites bi-monthly between April 2018
            and February 2019 (April, June, August, October, December and February). Samples were
            removed from each core at a depth of 05-10 cm, homogenized and stored on ice in the
            field before long-term storage at -20°C. </para>
          <para>Climate data:</para>
          <para>Site water levels and soil temperatures were monitored on a continuous basis between
            September 2017 and February 2020 with Campbell Scientific CR300 Dataloggers (Logan, USA)
            and HOBO Dataloggers (Bourne, USA), respectively. Additional data on regional
            precipitation and temperature were accessed on 31.03.2022 from the Deutscher
            Wetterdienst at weather station 1757 in Greifswald (54.0962, 13.4057). Information on
            soil moisture and physicochemical measurements is included in the supplementary
            information.</para>
          <para>Amplicon sequencing: </para>
          <para>The RNA and 16S rRNA extraction protocols and amplicon sequencing have previously
            been described in detail and are included in the supplementary documentation [1,2,4].
            The qPCR protocol for the 16S rRNA gene is also described in these publications. Here,
            the absolute copy numbers of the 16S rRNA gene in each sample is multiplied with the
            relative abundance of each ASV in the 16S rRNA metagenome to analyze their absolute
            abundances. </para>
          <para>qPCR:</para>
          <para>Quantitative PCR of bacterial and archaeal amoA genes were performed with the
            amoA-1F/2R [5] and camoA-19F [6,7] /tamoA-629R [8] primer pairs, respectively. The 15 μl
            reactions included 7.5 μl innuMIX qPCR DSGreen Standard 2x (Analytik Jena), 0.75 μl each
            of the primer pairs, 5 μl nuclease-free water and 1 μl template diluted to a
            concentration of 5 ng/μl. Reactions were cycled on a qTOWER³G (Analytik Jena) according
            to the following protocol: denaturation at 95°C for 2 minutes (archaeal amoA) and 5
            minutes (bacterial amoA); 40 3-step cycles of 30 seconds denaturation at 95°C, 45
            seconds annealing at 55°C, and elongation and scanning for 45 seconds at 72°C; and
            finally melting from 60 to 95°C for 15 seconds with ΔT 1°C. The reactions were
            quantified based on serial dilution standard curves of 10⁸-10² gene copies for bacterial
            amoA from Nitrosopira multiformis [9] and 10⁷-10¹ gene copies for archaeal amoA from
            Nitrososphaera viennensis [10]. The mean qPCR correlation coefficients for both the
            archaeal and bacterial amoA reactions were 0.99; the average slopes were -3.60 and
            -3.44, respectively, for the archaeal and bacterial reactions; and the mean reaction
            efficiencies were 0.90 and 0.96. </para>
          <para>RT-qPCR:</para>
          <para>The protocol for reverse transcription qPCR (hereafter RT-qPCR) with the RNA
            extractions used the same reaction cycles respective to bacterial and archaeal amoA,
            with the addition of an initial 10 minute reverse transcription step at 50°C. The 15 μl
            reactions again contained 0.75 μl each of the same forward and reverse primers and 5 μl
            nuclease-free water. For RT-qPCR, the mastermix additionally contained 0.02 μl BSA (20
            mg/ml concentration), 1 μl RNA template, and the following components from the iTaq
            Universal SYBR Green One-Step Kit (BioRad, California, USA): 7.5 μl iTaqSYBRMix and
            0.1875 μl iScript reverse transcriptase. To transcribe the standards, 20 ul reactions
            containing 1 ug template DNA, 1 mM each ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP, 2 ul 10x Transcription
            Buffer, 40 U T7 RNA Polymerase, 20 U RNase Inhibitor, and up to 20 ul nuclease-free
            water were incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Then, the reaction was stopped by adding 2 ul
            EDTA and 2 ul lithium chloride and gently mixing before adding 75 ul 75% ethanol and
            incubating at -80°C for 30 minutes. The standards were centrifuged at maximum speed for
            15 minutes at 4°C before discarding the supernatant and washing the pellet with 100 ul
            of 100% ethanol. The ethanol was then removed and the RNA pellet was left to dry on ice
            for 5 minutes before being resuspended in 20-50 ul nuclease-free water. Finally, the
            remaining DNA in the standards was digested with the DNase I kit (Zymo Research,
            California, USA). The RT-qPCR protocol for AOA resulted in an efficiency of 0.93 and
            slope of -3.52 (R² = 0.999); the results of the AOB protocol were an efficiency of 0.88
            and slope of -3.65 (R² = 0.999). </para>
