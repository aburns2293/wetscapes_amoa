Soil sampling:

Soil samples were collected from WETSCAPES project sites between April 2017 and October 2019 [1,2,3]. Samples were collected from a rewetted percolation fen (PW) and a rewetted coastal fen (CW) in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. PW is in the catchment areas of the rivers Trebel and Recknitz and was deeply drained in the 20th century before rewetting in 1998 as part of an EU-Life initiative [2].  CW was first drained for agricultural purposes in 1850 and rewetted via dike removal in 1993; since then, it has been periodically been flooded by brackish water from the Bay of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea [2]. While CW is currently used for cattle pasture, the PW site is not utilized for agricultural purposes and is managed via biannual mowing 2].

Three peat cores were sampled from each of the sites bi-monthly between April 2018 and February 2019 (April, June, August, October, December and February). Samples were removed from each core at a depth of 05-10 cm, homogenized and stored on ice in the field before long-term storage at -20°C. 

Climate data:

Site water levels and soil temperatures were monitored on a continuous basis between September 2017 and February 2020 with Campbell Scientific CR300 Dataloggers (Logan, USA) and HOBO Dataloggers (Bourne, USA), respectively. Additional data on regional precipitation and temperature were accessed on 31.03.2022 from the Deutscher Wetterdienst at weather station 1757 in Greifswald (54.0962, 13.4057). Information on soil moisture and physicochemical measurements is included in the supplementary information.

Amplicon sequencing: 

The RNA and 16S rRNA extraction protocols and amplicon sequencing have previously been described in detail and are included in the supplementary documentation [1,2,4]. The qPCR protocol for the 16S rRNA gene is also described in these publications. Here, the absolute copy numbers of the 16S rRNA gene in each sample is multiplied with the relative abundance of each ASV in the 16S rRNA metagenome to analyze their absolute abundances. 

qPCR:

Quantitative PCR of bacterial and archaeal amoA genes were performed with the amoA-1F/2R [5] and camoA-19F [6,7] /tamoA-629R [8] primer pairs, respectively. The 15 μl reactions included 7.5 μl innuMIX qPCR DSGreen Standard 2x (Analytik Jena), 0.75 μl each of the primer pairs, 5 μl nuclease-free water and 1 μl template diluted to a concentration of 5 ng/μl. Reactions were cycled on a qTOWER³G (Analytik Jena) according to the following protocol: denaturation at 95°C for 2 minutes (archaeal amoA) and 5 minutes (bacterial amoA); 40 3-step cycles of 30 seconds denaturation at 95°C, 45 seconds annealing at 55°C, and elongation and scanning for 45 seconds at 72°C; and finally melting from 60 to 95°C for 15 seconds with ΔT 1°C. The reactions were quantified based on serial dilution standard curves of 10⁸-10² gene copies for bacterial amoA from Nitrosopira multiformis [9] and 10⁷-10¹ gene copies for archaeal amoA from Nitrososphaera viennensis [10]. The mean qPCR correlation coefficients for both the archaeal and bacterial amoA reactions were 0.99; the average slopes were -3.60 and -3.44, respectively, for the archaeal and bacterial reactions; and the mean reaction efficiencies were 0.90 and 0.96. 

RT-qPCR:

The protocol for reverse transcription qPCR (hereafter RT-qPCR) with the RNA extractions used the same reaction cycles respective to bacterial and archaeal amoA, with the addition of an initial 10 minute reverse transcription step at 50°C. The 15 μl reactions again contained 0.75 μl each of the same forward and reverse primers and 5 μl nuclease-free water. For RT-qPCR, the mastermix additionally contained 0.02 μl BSA (20 mg/ml concentration), 1 μl RNA template, and the following components from the iTaq Universal SYBR Green One-Step Kit (BioRad, California, USA): 7.5 μl iTaqSYBRMix and 0.1875 μl iScript reverse transcriptase. To transcribe the standards, 20 ul reactions containing 1 ug template DNA, 1 mM each ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP, 2 ul 10x Transcription Buffer, 40 U T7 RNA Polymerase, 20 U RNase Inhibitor, and up to 20 ul nuclease-free water were incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Then, the reaction was stopped by adding 2 ul EDTA and 2 ul lithium chloride and gently mixing before adding 75 ul 75% ethanol and incubating at -80°C for 30 minutes. The standards were centrifuged at maximum speed for 15 minutes at 4°C before discarding the supernatant and washing the pellet with 100 ul of 100% ethanol. The ethanol was then removed and the RNA pellet was left to dry on ice for 5 minutes before being resuspended in 20-50 ul nuclease-free water. Finally, the remaining DNA in the standards was digested with the DNase I kit (Zymo Research, California, USA). The RT-qPCR protocol for AOA resulted in an efficiency of 0.93 and slope of -3.52 (R² = 0.999); the results of the AOB protocol were an efficiency of 0.88 and slope of -3.65 (R² = 0.999).
