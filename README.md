# Ammonia oxidizer drought responses in drained and rewetted peatlands

This is the Git repository for the manuscript [TBD], investigating the impact of extreme drought on nitrifying microbes in rewetted temperate fens, with a particular focus on quantifying the differing responses of ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria.

The following data and scripts are included:

1.  Defining drought thresholds via k-means clustering
    *Data: water table summary, sample data, local precipitation and temperature data*

2.  16S rRNA relative abundance ASVs community composition
    *Data: 16S rRNA relative abundance data, sample information*

3.  Functional and phylogenetic assignment of ammonia oxidizers and potential comammox. 

   *AOA classification were conducted via amoA tree construction, and as such is not included in these scripts. However, the 
    treefile and phylogenetic classification is available in the folder 'Phylogenetic_Tree.'*

   *Data: 16S rRNA absolute abundances, taxonomic labels, sample information, potential commamox ASVs*

4.  Trends during the 2018 drought cycle in Northern Germany for:

    a.  Nutrients
   *Data: sample information*

    b.  qPCR (DNA-based) of bacterial and archaeal amoA gene copy numbers
    *Data: qPCR results of archaeal and bacterial amoA*

    c.  RT-qPCR (RNA-based) of bacterial and archaeal amoA gene copy numbers
    *Data: RT-qPCR results of archaeal and bacterial amoA, qPCR data to compare methods*

    d.  Metatranscriptomic analysis of bacterial and archaeal amoABC genes
    *Data: AOA and AOB SSU files*

    e.  Analysis of AOA clade assignment from phylogenetic tree
    *Data: 16S rRNA relative abundanace data, sample and taxonomic information, clade assignments, 16S rRNA absolute abundances *

    f.  KEGG analysis of metatranscriptomic data for nitrification indicator genes
    *Data: KEGG outputs for nitrogen cycling genes taxonomy, abundance, and taxonomic information*
