# Ammonia oxidizer drought responses in drained and rewetted peatlands

This is the Git repository for the manuscript [TBD], investigating the impact of extreme drought on nitrifying microbes in rewetted temperate fens, with a particular focus on quantifying the differing responses of ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria.

The following data and scripts are included:

1.  Defining drought thresholds via k-means clustering

2.  16S rRNA relative abundance ASVs community composition

3.  Functional and phylogenetic assignment of ammonia oxidizers and potential comammox. 

    -   *AOA classification were conducted via amoA tree construction, and as such is not included in these scripts. However, the treefile and phylogenetic classification is available in the folder 'Phylogenetic_Tree.'*

4.  Trends during the 2018 drought cycle in Northern Germany for:

    a.  Nutrients

    b.  qPCR (DNA-based) of bacterial and archaeal amoA gene copy numbers

    c.  RT-qPCR (RNA-based) of bacterial and archaeal amoA gene copy numbers

    d.  Metatranscriptomic analysis of bacterial and archaeal amoABC genes

    e.  Analysis of AOA clade assignment from phylogenetic tree

    f.  KEGG analysis of metatranscriptomic data for nitrification indicator genes
