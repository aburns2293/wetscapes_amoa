This is the Git repository for the manuscript [TBD], investigating the impact of extreme drought on nitrifying microbes in rewetted temperate fens, with a particular focus on quantifying the differing responses of ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria.

The following data and scripts are included:

1.  Defining drought thresholds via k-means clustering

2.  16S rRNA relative abundance ASVs community composition

3.  Functional and phylogenetic assignment of ammonia oxidizers and potential comammox.

*AOA classification were conducted via amoA tree construction, and as such is not included in these scripts. However, the treefile and phylogenetic classification is available in the folder 'Phylogenetic_Tree.'*

4.  Trends during the 2018 drought in Northern Germany for:

    a.  Nutrients

    b.  qPCR (DNA-based) of bacterial and archaeal amoA gene copy numbers

    c.  RT-qPCR (RNA-based) of bacterial and archaeal amoA gene copy numbers

    d.  Metatranscriptomic taxonomy analysis of amoABC based on SSU RNA

    e.  Analysis of AOA clade assignment from phylogenetic tree

    f.  KEGG analysis of mRNA-based metatranscriptomes for nitrogen cycling pathways
