# Ammonia oxidizer drought responses in drained and rewetted peatlands

To-Do:

-   Finish phylogenetic tree + upload data
-   qPCR for AmoA-A/B enzymes
-   Finish bolded sections

This is the Git repository for the manuscript [TBD], describing differential trends in the community composition of ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria of both rewetted and drained peatlands in response to the 2018 drought cycle in northern Germany. The peatland sites are part of the Wetscapes project and are located in the vicinity of Greifswald, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.

The following data and scripts are included:

1.  Defining drought thresholds via k-means clustering

2.  16S rRNA relative abundance ASVs community composition

3.  Functional and phylogenetic assignment of ammonia oxidizers and potential comammox. **- NEED AOB qPCR results!**

    -   *AOA classification were conducted via amoA tree construction, and as such is not included in these scripts. However, the treefile and phylogenetic classification is available in the folder 'Classification.'*

4.  **Trends during the 2018 drought cycle in Northern Germany for:**

    1.  Nutrients

    2.  **16S rRNA relative abundance - waiting on tree for AOA (use Blast ID for AOB)**

    3.  **16S rRNA and qPCR absolute abundance - amoA qPCR for AOB and AOA**

        -   *Classification vs. enzyme qPCR method comparison*

    4.  **Metatranscriptomics support**
